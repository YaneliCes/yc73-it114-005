<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I did have trouble figuring out how and where to start my code<br>in the file Server.java. I resolved this by visiting Professor Toegel during office<br>hours, where he helped a small group of us who had the same<br>question. I learned it was as simple as using else if statements in<br>the method &quot;processCommand.&quot;<br></p><br></td></tr>
